# SD-TSIA-210: Machine Learning
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course SD-TSIA-210 at Télécom Paris

Statistical learning is concerned with the inference of models for pattern recognition, the prediction and diagnostic in a probabilistic and statistical setting.
The course first presents how to set a supervised learning problem both in classification and regression, how to solve the underlying optimization task and how to evaluate the resulting estimates. In supervised classification, both discriminant and generative approaches will be presented. A short introduction to unsupervised learning will conclude the course. 

his course is not open to students enrolled in the SD or TSIA programmes.

Statistical learning is concerned with model inference for pattern recognition, prediction and diagnosis in a probabilistic and statistical framework.
In this course, students will learn to
- to pose a supervised learning problem (classification and regression) by formulating it as a statistical criterion optimization problem,
- to develop an appropriate learning algorithm
- and to evaluate the classification or regression function thus constructed.
The main models and algorithms of supervised learning such as perceptron, SVM/SVR, tree, ensemble methods) will be studied as well as some generative approaches. A short introduction to unsupervised learning will also be given.
